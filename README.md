# Docker development setup

1) Install Docker.app

2) gem install stack_car

3) We recommend committing .env to your repo with good defaults. .env.development, .env.production etc can be used for local overrides and should not be in the repo.

4) sc up

``` bash
gem install stack_car
sc up

```
# REU Manager v3

### Development setup
first make sure that you have docker installed. On Mac OS use docker for mac and on Windows use docker for windows.  
Once you start it check the preferences and make sure that is has at least 3 gb of ram allocated to it.
make sure to login to `docker login registry.gitlab.com` use your gitlab credentials to login.

1. git clone the repo from https://gitlab.com/notch8/reumanager and switch to the v3 branch
2. get a .env file for the project from someone on the team
3. run `docker-compose pull web`
4. run `docker-compose up`
once you have the containers up and running
5. run `docker-compose exec web bash` this will give you a console in the container running rails
6. run `rails db:create db:migrate db:seed` in the container
7. in a browser go to test.lvh.me:3000

to get to the new admin go to http://test.lvh.me:3000/reu_program/dashboard.
the seeds setup a program admin for you. email: admin@test.com password: testing123

# REU Manager v2

```bash
When creating a new instance of REU:
create a new branch that will be the 'master' of the new app
docker-compose build
sc up
docker-compose exec web bash
rake db:create db:migrate
rake db:seed settings:load
```

# Deploy a new release

``` bash
sc release {staging | production} # creates and pushes the correct tags
sc deploy {staging | production} # deployes those tags to the server
```

Releaese and Deployment are handled by the gitlab ci by default. See ops/deploy-app to deploy from locally, but note all Rancher install pull the currently tagged registry image

## Info
This program facilitates the application process for science oriented [NSF REU programs](http://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/) and is developed by the IT staff of the [UC San Diego Institute of Engineering in Medicine](https://iem.ucsd.edu/).

[REU Manager](https://reumanager.com) is built with [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) and is completely free to host/maintain yourself.   You can see a demonstration of the site at: https://reumanager.com/new_demo .  You may login as the administrative user with the email admin@reumanager.com and the password DemoApp.

Below are instructions for those who wish to install and maintain the application using their own equipment.
